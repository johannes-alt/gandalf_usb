==== amc_hax.py ====
Small tool to read data recorded with spyread (VME or USB version, use option '-r' to read data w/o LDC/GDC headers)
By default opens a ROOT GUI with tabs for each channel and creates histos of amplitudes.

Can be used to cycle through frame events and display them event-by-event (option '-f')

Further usage, see
> amc_hax.py -h

=== feel free to improve ;)


--- how to use amc_hax.py for some analysis
-- create python script somewhere, here 'test.py'
import amc_hax

file_ = 'some/file/'

with open(file_) as f_:
    for evnt in amc_hax.events(f_):
        print 'event',evnt.ev, evnt.spill
        if 0 in evnt.hits: print 'hits on channel 0:',[(hit.ch,hit.amplitude,hit.time) for hit in evnt.hits[0]]
        if evnt.is_frame():
            print 'frame sampels for channel 0',evnt.frames[0]

-- execute like
PYTHONPATH=~/workspace/amc_hax/:$PYTHONPATH python test.py

-- if file was written with VME spyread (i.e., no DATE LDC/GDC headers), use 'amc_hax.events(f_, amc_hax.PATTERN_SLINK)'
